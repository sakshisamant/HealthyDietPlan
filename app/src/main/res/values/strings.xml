        <b>1. Add, Don\'t Subtract</b> \n\n
        Forget diet denial: Try adding foods to your diet instead of subtracting them.
        Add in healthy goodies you really love, like deep-red cherries, juicy grapes,
        or crunchy snow peas. Slip those favorite fruits into your bag lunch and breakfast
        cereal; add the veggies into soups, stews, and sauces.\n\n

        <b>2. Lighten the Foods You Already Love</b> \n\n
        One of the easiest ways to cut back without feeling denied is to switch to lower-calorie
        versions of the foods you crave. A pizza tastes just as good with reduced-fat cheese, and
        when you garnish low-fat ice cream with your favorite toppers, who notices those missing calories?\n\n

        <b>3. Because Hydration Helps -- Really!</b> \n\n
        Down some water before a meal and you won\'t feel so famished, says David Anthony, an information
        technology consultant from Atlanta. "Drinking a glass of water before a meal helps me watch what
        I eat. â€¦ I don\'t just hog everything, since I\'m not so hungry."\n\n

        <b>4. Do not overtake the stimulants</b>\n\n
        Avoid frequent drinking of tea and coffee in a day. Also stop the consumption of bed tea or bed coffee.
        Because the use of caffeine is harmful when you take it on an empty stomach. It raises the stress level
        which is a reason for the increase of hunger. So, you can understand that caffeine is a reason for obesity indirectly.\n\n

        <b>5. Drink Plenty of water</b>\n\n
        Water is a zero calorie drink with low sodium. It helps flush out the toxic substances build-up inside the body.
        Frequent water consumption increases the rate of metabolism.\n

        This helps to keep your body hydrated and maintain the electrolyte balance in the body.\n\n
